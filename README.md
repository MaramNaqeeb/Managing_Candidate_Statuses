## Testing the feature of managing the candidate statuses using OrangeHRM website
#### This automation testing project aim at testing the feature of asserting candidate statuses, uploading and downloading a file for the candidates, and asserting the content of the download file using TypeScript language and Cucumber framework to create API and UI test cases. In addition, I generate an allure report to show the behavior of the test cases.
